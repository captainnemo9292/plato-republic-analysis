0,"Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house ; and there we found his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus , and with them Thrasymachus the Chalcedonian , Charmantides the Paeanian , and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
1,"There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus , whom I had not seen for a long time , and I thought him very much aged",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
2,"He was seated on a cushioned chair , and had a garland on his head , for he had been sacrificing in the court ; and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle , upon which we sat down by him",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
3,"He saluted me eagerly , and then he said : -- You do n't come to see me , Socrates , as often as you ought : If I were still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
4,"But at my age I can hardly get to the city , and therefore you should come oftener to the Piraeus",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
5,"For let me tell you , that the more the pleasures of the body fade away , the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
6,"Do not then deny my request , but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men ; we are old friends , and you will be quite at home with us",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
7,"I replied : There is nothing which for my part I like better , Cephalus , than conversing with aged men ; for I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which I too may have to go , and of whom I ought to enquire , whether the way is smooth and easy , or rugged and difficult",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
8,"And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age' -- Is life harder towards the end , or what report do you give of it",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
9,"I will tell you , Socrates , he said , what my own feeling is",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
10,"Men of my age flock together ; we are birds of a feather , as the old proverb says ; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is -- I can not eat , I can not drink ; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away : there was a good time once , but now that is gone , and life is no longer life",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
11,"Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations , and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
12,"But to me , Socrates , these complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
13,"For if old age were the cause , I too being old , and every other old man , would have felt as they do",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
14,"But this is not my own experience , nor that of others whom I have known",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
15,"How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles , when in answer to the question , How does love suit with age , Sophocles , -- are you still the man you were",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
16,"Peace , he replied ; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak ; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
17,"His words have often occurred to my mind since , and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
18,"For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom ; when the passions relax their hold , then , as Sophocles says , we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only , but of many",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
19,"The truth is , Socrates , that these regrets , and also the complaints about relations , are to be attributed to the same cause , which is not old age , but men 's characters and tempers ; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age , but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
20,"I listened in admiration , and wanting to draw him out , that he might go on -- Yes , Cephalus , I said : but I rather suspect that people in general are not convinced by you when you speak thus ; they think that old age sits lightly upon you , not because of your happy disposition , but because you are rich , and wealth is well known to be a great comforter",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
21,"You are right , he replied ; they are not convinced : and there is something in what they say ; not , however , so much as they imagine",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
22,"I might answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and saying that he was famous , not for his own merits but because he was an Athenian : 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours , neither of us would have been famous",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
23,"' And to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age , the same reply may be made ; for to the good poor man old age can not be a light burden , nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
24,"May I ask , Cephalus , whether your fortune was for the most part inherited or acquired by you",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
25,Socrates ; do you want to know how much I acquired,NEUTRAL,Cephalus
26,"In the art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather : for my grandfather , whose name I bear , doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony , that which he inherited being much what I possess now ; but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present : and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more than I received",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
27,"That was why I asked you the question , I replied , because I see that you are indifferent about money , which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them ; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own , resembling the affection of authors for their own poems , or of parents for their children , besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
28,"And hence they are very bad company , for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
29,"That is true , he said",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
30,"Yes , that is very true , but may I ask another question",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
31,What do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth,NEUTRAL,Cephalus
32,"One , he said , of which I could not expect easily to convince others",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
33,"For let me tell you , Socrates , that when a man thinks himself to be near death , fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before ; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him , but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true : either from the weakness of age , or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place , he has a clearer view of these things ; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him , and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
34,"And when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear , and he is filled with dark forebodings",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
35,"But to him who is conscious of no sin , sweet hope , as Pindar charmingly says , is the kind nurse of his age : Hope , he says , cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey ; -- hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
36,How admirable are his words,NEUTRAL,Cephalus
37,"And the great blessing of riches , I do not say to every man , but to a good man , is , that he has had no occasion to deceive or to defraud others , either intentionally or unintentionally ; and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
38,"Now to this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes ; and therefore I say , that , setting one thing against another , of the many advantages which wealth has to give , to a man of sense this is in my opinion the greatest",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
39,"Well said , Cephalus , I replied ; but as concerning justice , what is it",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
40,-- to speak the truth and to pay your debts -- no more than this,NEGATIVE,Cephalus
41,And even to this are there not exceptions,NEUTRAL,Cephalus
42,"Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind , ought I to give them back to him",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
43,"No one would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so , any more than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
44,"You are quite right , he replied",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
45,"But then , I said , speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a correct definition of justice",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
46,"Cephalus - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS Quite correct , Socrates , if Simonides is to be believed , said Polemarchus interposing",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
47,"I fear , said Cephalus , that I must go now , for I have to look after the sacrifices , and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company",NEGATIVE,Cephalus
48,Is not Polemarchus your heir,NEGATIVE,Cephalus
49,"To be sure , he answered , and went away laughing to the sacrifices",NEUTRAL,Cephalus
50,"Socrates - GLAUCON I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston , that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess ; and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival , which was a new thing",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
51,"I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants ; but that of the Thracians was equally , if not more , beautiful",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
52,"When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle , we turned in the direction of the city ; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home , and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
53,"The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind , and said : Polemarchus desires you to wait",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
54,"I turned round , and asked him where his master was",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
55,"There he is , said the youth , coming after you , if you will only wait",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
56,"Certainly we will , said Glaucon ; and in a few minutes Polemarchus appeared , and with him Adeimantus , Glaucon 's brother , Niceratus the son of Nicias , and several others who had been at the procession",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
57,"Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS Polemarchus said to me : I perceive , Socrates , that you and our companion are already on your way to the city",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
58,"You are not far wrong , I said",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
59,"But do you see , he rejoined , how many we are",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
60,And are you stronger than all these,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
61,"for if not , you will have to remain where you are",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
62,"May there not be the alternative , I said , that we may persuade you to let us go",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
63,"But can you persuade us , if we refuse to listen to you",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
64,"Certainly not , replied Glaucon",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
65,Then we are not going to listen ; of that you may be assured,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
66,Adeimantus added : Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
67,I replied : That is a novelty,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
68,Will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
69,"Yes , said Polemarchus , and not only so , but a festival will he celebrated at night , which you certainly ought to see",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
70,"Let us rise soon after supper and see this festival ; there will be a gathering of young men , and we will have a good talk",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
71,"Stay then , and do not be perverse",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
72,"Glaucon said : I suppose , since you insist , that we must",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
73,"Very good , I replied",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
74,"Socrates - POLEMARCHUS Tell me then , O thou heir of the argument , what did Simonides say , and according to you truly say , about justice",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
75,"He said that the repayment of a debt is just , and in saying so he appears to me to be right",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
76,"I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man , but his meaning , though probably clear to you , is the reverse of clear to me",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
77,"For he certainly does not mean , as we were now saying that I ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it when he is not in his right senses ; and yet a deposit can not be denied to be a debt",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
78,Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no means to make the return,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
79,"When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice , he did not mean to include that case",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
80,Certainly not ; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
81,"You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of the receiver , if the two parties are friends , is not the repayment of a debt , -- that is what you would imagine him to say",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
82,And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
83,"To be sure , he said , they are to receive what we owe them , and an enemy , as I take it , owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him -- that is to say , evil",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
84,"Simonides , then , after the manner of poets , would seem to have spoken darkly of the nature of justice ; for he really meant to say that justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him , and this he termed a debt",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
85,"That must have been his meaning , he said",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
86,"I replied ; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine , and to whom , what answer do you think that he would make to us",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
87,He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to human bodies,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
88,"And what due or proper thing is given by cookery , and to what",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
89,"And what is that which justice gives , and to whom",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
90,"If , Socrates , we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding instances , then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
91,That is his meaning then,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
92,And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
93,"Or when they are on a voyage , amid the perils of the sea",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
94,And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
95,In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
96,"But when a man is well , my dear Polemarchus , there is no need of a physician",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
97,And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
98,Then in time of peace justice will be of no use,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
99,I am very far from thinking so,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
100,You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
101,Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
102,"Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes , -- that is what you mean",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
103,And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
104,"In contracts , Socrates , justice is of use",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
105,And by contracts you mean partnerships,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
106,But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a game of draughts,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
107,The skilful player,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
108,And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
109,"Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harp-player , as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a better partner than the just man",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
110,In a money partnership,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
111,"Yes , Polemarchus , but surely not in the use of money ; for you do not want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse ; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that , would he not",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
112,"And when you want to buy a ship , the shipwright or the pilot would be better",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
113,Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be preferred,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
114,When you want a deposit to be kept safely,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
115,"You mean when money is not wanted , but allowed to lie",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
116,"That is to say , justice is useful when money is useless",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
117,That is the inference,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
118,"And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe , then justice is useful to the individual and to the state ; but when you want to use it , then the art of the vine-dresser",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
119,"And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre , and not to use them , you would say that justice is useful ; but when you want to use them , then the art of the soldier or of the musician",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
120,"And so of all the other things ; -- justice is useful when they are useless , and useless when they are useful",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
121,That is the inference,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
122,Then justice is not good for much,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
123,But let us consider this further point : Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
124,And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
125,And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the enemy,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
126,Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
127,"That , I suppose , is to be inferred",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
128,"Then if the just man is good at keeping money , he is good at stealing it",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
129,That is implied in the argument,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
130,Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
131,"And this is a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer ; for he , speaking of Autolycus , the maternal grandfather of Odysseus , who is a favourite of his , affirms that He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
132,"And so , you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft ; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies , ' -- that was what you were saying",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
133,"No , certainly not that , though I do not now know what I did say ; but I still stand by the latter words",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
134,"Well , there is another question : By friends and enemies do we mean those who are so really , or only in seeming",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
135,"Surely , he said , a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good , and to hate those whom he thinks evil",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
136,"Yes , but do not persons often err about good and evil : many who are not good seem to be so , and conversely",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
137,Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
138,And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
139,But the good are just and would not do an injustice,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
140,Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
141,"Nay , Socrates ; the doctrine is immoral",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
142,Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
143,I like that better,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
144,"But see the consequence : -- Many a man who is ignorant of human nature has friends who are bad friends , and in that case he ought to do harm to them ; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit ; but , if so , we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning of Simonides",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
145,"Very true , he said : and I think that we had better correct an error into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and 'enemy",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
146,"' What was the error , Polemarchus",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
147,We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
148,And how is the error to be corrected,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
149,"We should rather say that he is a friend who is , as well as seems , good ; and that he who seems only , and is not good , only seems to be and is not a friend ; and of an enemy the same may be said",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
150,You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
151,"And instead of saying simply as we did at first , that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies , we should further say : It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
152,"Yes , that appears to me to be the truth",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
153,But ought the just to injure any one at all,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
154,Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
155,"When horses are injured , are they improved or deteriorated",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
156,"Deteriorated , that is to say , in the good qualities of horses , not of dogs",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
157,"And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs , and not of horses",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
158,And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the proper virtue of man,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
159,And that human virtue is justice,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
160,Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
161,But can the musician by his art make men unmusical,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
162,Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
163,"And can the just by justice make men unjust , or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
164,Any more than heat can produce cold,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
165,Or drought moisture,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
166,Nor can the good harm any one,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
167,And the just is the good,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
168,"Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man , but of the opposite , who is the unjust",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
169,"I think that what you say is quite true , Socrates",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
170,"Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts , and that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends , and evil the debt which he owes to his enemies , -- to say this is not wise ; for it is not true , if , as has been clearly shown , the injuring of another can be in no case just",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
171,"I agree with you , said Polemarchus",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
172,"Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus , or any other wise man or seer",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
173,"I am quite ready to do battle at your side , he said",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
174,Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be,NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
175,"I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban , or some other rich and mighty man , who had a great opinion of his own power , was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
176,"' Most true , he said",NEUTRAL,Polemarchus
177,"Yes , I said ; but if this definition of justice also breaks down , what other can be offered",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
178,"Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands , and had been put down by the rest of the company , who wanted to hear the end",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
179,"But when Polemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause , he could no longer hold his peace ; and , gathering himself up , he came at us like a wild beast , seeking to devour us",NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
180,We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of him,NEGATIVE,Polemarchus
181,Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS He roared out to the whole company : What folly,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
182,"Socrates , has taken possession of you all",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
183,"And why , sillybillies , do you knock under to one another",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
184,"I say that if you want really to know what justice is , you should not only ask but answer , and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent , but have your own answer ; for there is many a one who can ask and can not answer",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
185,"And now I will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest , for this sort of nonsense will not do for me ; I must have clearness and accuracy",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
186,"I was panic-stricken at his words , and could not look at him without trembling",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
187,"Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him , I should have been struck dumb : but when I saw his fury rising , I looked at him first , and was therefore able to reply to him",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
188,"Thrasymachus , I said , with a quiver , do n't be hard upon us",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
189,"Polemarchus and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument , but I can assure you that the error was not intentional",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
190,"If we were seeking for a piece of gold , you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one another , ' and so losing our chance of finding it",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
191,"And why , when we are seeking for justice , a thing more precious than many pieces of gold , do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
192,"Nay , my good friend , we are most willing and anxious to do so , but the fact is that we can not",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
193,"And if so , you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
194,How characteristic of Socrates,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
195,"he replied , with a bitter laugh ; -- that's your ironical style",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
196,"Did I not foresee -- have I not already told you , that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer , and try irony or any other shuffle , in order that he might avoid answering",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
197,"You are a philosopher , Thrasymachus , I replied , and well know that if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve , taking care to prohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six , or three times four , or six times two , or four times three , 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for me , ' -- then obviously , that is your way of putting the question , no one can answer you",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
198,"But suppose that he were to retort , 'Thrasymachus , what do you mean",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
199,"If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question , am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right one",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
200,-- is that your meaning,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
201,' -How would you answer him,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
202,Just as if the two cases were at all alike,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
203,Why should they not be,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
204,"I replied ; and even if they are not , but only appear to be so to the person who is asked , ought he not to say what he thinks , whether you and I forbid him or not",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
205,I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
206,"I dare say that I may , notwithstanding the danger , if upon reflection I approve of any of them",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
207,"But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better , he said , than any of these",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
208,What do you deserve to have done to you,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
209,"-- as becomes the ignorant , I must learn from the wise -- that is what I deserve to have done to me",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
210,"What , and no payment",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
211,"I will pay when I have the money , I replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
212,"Socrates - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON But you have , Socrates , said Glaucon : and you , Thrasymachus , need be under no anxiety about money , for we will all make a contribution for Socrates",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
213,"Yes , he replied , and then Socrates will do as he always does -- refuse to answer himself , but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
214,"Why , my good friend , I said , how can any one answer who knows , and says that he knows , just nothing ; and who , even if he has some faint notions of his own , is told by a man of authority not to utter them",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
215,"The natural thing is , that the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
216,"Will you then kindly answer , for the edification of the company and of myself",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
217,"Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus , as any one might see , was in reality eager to speak ; for he thought that he had an excellent answer , and would distinguish himself",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
218,But at first he to insist on my answering ; at length he consented to begin,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
219,"Behold , he said , the wisdom of Socrates ; he refuses to teach himself , and goes about learning of others , to whom he never even says thank you",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
220,"That I learn of others , I replied , is quite true ; but that I am ungrateful I wholly deny",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
221,"Money I have none , and therefore I pay in praise , which is all I have : and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer ; for I expect that you will answer well",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
222,"Listen , then , he said ; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
223,And now why do you not me,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
224,But of course you wo n't,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
225,"Let me first understand you , I replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
226,"justice , as you say , is the interest of the stronger",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
227,"What , Thrasymachus , is the meaning of this",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
228,"You can not mean to say that because Polydamas , the pancratiast , is stronger than we are , and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength , that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is , and right and just for us",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
229,"That 's abominable of you , Socrates ; you take the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
230,"Not at all , my good sir , I said ; I am trying to understand them ; and I wish that you would be a little clearer",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
231,"Well , he said , have you never heard that forms of government differ ; there are tyrannies , and there are democracies , and there are aristocracies",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
232,And the government is the ruling power in each state,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
233,"And the different forms of government make laws democratical , aristocratical , tyrannical , with a view to their several interests ; and these laws , which are made by them for their own interests , are the justice which they deliver to their subjects , and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law , and unjust",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
234,"And that is what I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of justice , which is the interest of the government ; and as the government must be supposed to have power , the only reasonable conclusion is , that everywhere there is one principle of justice , which is the interest of the stronger",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
235,"Now I understand you , I said ; and whether you are right or not I will try to discover",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
236,"But let me remark , that in defining justice you have yourself used the word 'interest ' which you forbade me to use",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
237,"It is true , however , that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are added",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
238,"A small addition , you must allow , he said",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
239,"Great or small , never mind about that : we must first enquire whether what you are saying is the truth",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
240,"Now we are both agreed that justice is interest of some sort , but you go on to say 'of the stronger ' ; about this addition I am not so sure , and must therefore consider further",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
241,"I will ; and first tell me , Do you admit that it is just or subjects to obey their rulers",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
242,"But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible , or are they sometimes liable to err",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
243,"To be sure , he replied , they are liable to err",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
244,"Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly , and sometimes not",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
245,"When they make them rightly , they make them agreeably to their interest ; when they are mistaken , contrary to their interest ; you admit that",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
246,"And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects , -- and that is what you call justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
247,"Then justice , according to your argument , is not only obedience to the interest of the stronger but the reverse",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
248,What is that you are saying,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
249,"I am only repeating what you are saying , I believe",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
250,"But let us consider : Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command , and also that to obey them is justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
251,Has not that been admitted,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
252,"Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest of the stronger , when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done which are to their own injury",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
253,"For if , as you say , justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands , in that case , O wisest of men , is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do , not what is for the interest , but what is for the injury of the stronger",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
254,"Nothing can be clearer , Socrates , said Polemarchus",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
255,"Socrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS Yes , said Cleitophon , interposing , if you are allowed to be his witness",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
256,"But there is no need of any witness , said Polemarchus , for Thrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for their own interest , and that for subjects to obey them is justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
257,"Yes , Polemarchus , -- Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was commanded by their rulers is just",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
258,"Yes , Cleitophon , but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger , and , while admitting both these propositions , he further acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do what is not for his own interest ; whence follows that justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
259,"But , said Cleitophon , he meant by the interest of the stronger what the stronger thought to be his interest , -- this was what the weaker had to do ; and this was affirmed by him to be justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
260,"Those were not his words , rejoined Polemarchus",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
261,"Socrates - THRASYMACHUS Never mind , I replied , if he now says that they are , let us accept his statement",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
262,"Tell me , Thrasymachus , I said , did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest , whether really so or not",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
263,"Certainly not , he said",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
264,Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
265,"Yes , I said , my impression was that you did so , when you admitted that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
266,"You argue like an informer , Socrates",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
267,"Do you mean , for example , that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
268,"or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake , in respect of the mistake",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
269,"True , we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake , but this is only a way of speaking ; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies ; they none of them err unless their skill fails them , and then they cease to be skilled artists",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
270,"No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name implies ; though he is commonly said to err , and I adopted the common mode of speaking",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
271,"But to be perfectly accurate , since you are such a lover of accuracy , we should say that the ruler , in so far as he is the ruler , is unerring , and , being unerring , always commands that which is for his own interest ; and the subject is required to execute his commands ; and therefore , as I said at first and now repeat , justice is the interest of the stronger",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
272,"Indeed , Thrasymachus , and do I really appear to you to argue like an informer",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
273,"Certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
274,And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring you in the argument,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
275,"Nay , he replied , 'suppose ' is not the word -- I know it ; but you will be found out , and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
276,"I shall not make the attempt , my dear man ; but to avoid any misunderstanding occurring between us in future , let me ask , in what sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest , as you were saying , he being the superior , it is just that the inferior should execute -- is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
277,"In the strictest of all senses , he said",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
278,And now cheat and play the informer if you can ; I ask no quarter at your hands,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
279,"But you never will be able , never",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
280,"And do you imagine , I said , that I am such a madman as to try and cheat , Thrasymachus",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
281,I might as well shave a lion,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
282,"Why , he said , you made the attempt a minute ago , and you failed",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
283,"Enough , I said , of these civilities",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
284,"It will be better that I should ask you a question : Is the physician , taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking , a healer of the sick or a maker of money",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
285,And remember that I am now speaking of the true physician,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
286,"A healer of the sick , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
287,"And the pilot -- that is to say , the true pilot -- is he a captain of sailors or a mere sailor",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
288,A captain of sailors,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
289,"The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into account ; neither is he to be called a sailor ; the name pilot by which he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing , but is significant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
290,"Very true , he said",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
291,"Now , I said , every art has an interest",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
292,For which the art has to consider and provide,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
293,"Yes , that is the aim of art",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
294,And the interest of any art is the perfection of it -- this and nothing else,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
295,I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
296,"Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has wants , I should reply : Certainly the body has wants ; for the body may be ill and require to be cured , and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine ministers ; and this is the origin and intention of medicine , as you will acknowledge",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
297,"Quite right , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
298,"But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of hearing , and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of seeing and hearing -- has art in itself , I say , any similar liability to fault or defect , and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for its interests , and that another and another without end",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
299,Or have the arts to look only after their own interests,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
300,Or have they no need either of themselves or of another,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
301,"-- having no faults or defects , they have no need to correct them , either by the exercise of their own art or of any other ; they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
302,"For every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true -- that is to say , while perfect and unimpaired",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
303,"Take the words in your precise sense , and tell me whether I am not right",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
304,"Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine , but the interest of the body",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
305,"Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship , but the interests of the horse ; neither do any other arts care for themselves , for they have no needs ; they care only for that which is the subject of their art",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
306,"But surely , Thrasymachus , the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
307,To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
308,"Then , I said , no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the stronger or superior , but only the interest of the subject and weaker",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
309,"He made an attempt to contest this proposition also , but finally acquiesced",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
310,"Then , I continued , no physician , in so far as he is a physician , considers his own good in what he prescribes , but the good of his patient ; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject , and is not a mere money-maker ; that has been admitted",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
311,"And the pilot likewise , in the strict sense of the term , is a ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
312,That has been admitted,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
313,"And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of the sailor who is under him , and not for his own or the ruler's interest",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
314,He gave a reluctant 'Yes,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
315,"' Then , I said , Thrasymachus , there is no one in any rule who , in so far as he is a ruler , considers or enjoins what is for his own interest , but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art ; to that he looks , and that alone he considers in everything which he says and does",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
316,"When we had got to this point in the argument , and every one saw that the definition of justice had been completely upset , Thrasymachus , instead of replying to me , said : Tell me , Socrates , have you got a nurse",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
317,"Why do you ask such a question , I said , when you ought rather to be answering",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
318,"Because she leaves you to snivel , and never wipes your nose : she has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
319,What makes you say that,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
320,"Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or his master ; and you further imagine that the rulers of states , if they are true rulers , never think of their subjects as sheep , and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
321,"Oh , no ; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in reality another 's good ; that is to say , the interest of the ruler and stronger , and the loss of the subject and servant ; and injustice the opposite ; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just : he is the stronger , and his subjects do what is for his interest , and minister to his happiness , which is very far from being their own",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
322,"Consider further , most foolish Socrates , that the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
323,"First of all , in private contracts : wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that , when the partnership is dissolved , the unjust man has always more and the just less",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
324,"Secondly , in their dealings with the State : when there is an income tax , the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income ; and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the other much",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
325,"Observe also what happens when they take an office ; there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses , and getting nothing out of the public , because he is just ; moreover he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
326,But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
327,"I am speaking , as before , of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is more apparent ; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men , and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable -- that is to say tyranny , which by fraud and force takes away the property of others , not little by little but wholesale ; comprehending in one , things sacred as well as profane , private and public ; for which acts of wrong , if he were detected perpetrating any one of them singly , he would be punished and incur great disgrace -- they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples , and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
328,"But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them , then , instead of these names of reproach , he is termed happy and blessed , not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
329,"For mankind censure injustice , fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
330,"And thus , as I have shown , Socrates , injustice , when on a sufficient scale , has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice ; and , as I said at first , justice is the interest of the stronger , whereas injustice is a man 's own profit and interest",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
331,"Thrasymachus , when he had thus spoken , having , like a bathman , deluged our ears with his words , had a mind to go away",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
332,But the company would not let him ; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position ; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
333,"Thrasymachus , I said to him , excellent man , how suggestive are your remarks",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
334,And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
335,Is the attempt to determine the way of man 's life so small a matter in your eyes -- to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
336,"And do I differ from you , he said , as to the importance of the enquiry",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
337,"You appear rather , I replied , to have no care or thought about us , Thrasymachus -- whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you know , is to you a matter of indifference",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
338,"Prithee , friend , do not keep your knowledge to yourself ; we are a large party ; and any benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
339,"For my own part I openly declare that I am not convinced , and that I do not believe injustice to be more gainful than justice , even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free play",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
340,"For , granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force , still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice , and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
341,"Perhaps we may be wrong ; if so , you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
342,"And how am I to convince you , he said , if you are not already convinced by what I have just said ; what more can I do for you",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
343,Would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
344,"I said ; I would only ask you to be consistent ; or , if you change , change openly and let there be no deception",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
345,"For I must remark , Thrasymachus , if you will recall what was previously said , that although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense , you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd ; you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good , but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table ; or , again , as a trader for sale in the market , and not as a shepherd",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
346,"Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects ; he has only to provide the best for them , since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
347,And that was what I was saying just now about the ruler,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
348,"I conceived that the art of the ruler , considered as ruler , whether in a state or in private life , could only regard the good of his flock or subjects ; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states , that is to say , the true rulers , like being in authority",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
349,"Nay , I am sure of it",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
350,"Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly without payment , unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage not of themselves but of others",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
351,"Let me ask you a question : Are not the several arts different , by reason of their each having a separate function",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
352,"And , my dear illustrious friend , do say what you think , that we may make a little progress",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
353,"Yes , that is the difference , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
354,"And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one -- medicine , for example , gives us health ; navigation , safety at sea , and so on",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
355,"And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay : but we do not confuse this with other arts , any more than the art of the pilot is to be confused with the art of medicine , because the health of the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
356,"You would not be inclined to say , would you , that navigation is the art of medicine , at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
357,Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
358,Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
359,"And we have admitted , I said , that the good of each art is specially confined to the art",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
360,"Then , if there be any good which all artists have in common , that is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common use",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
361,"And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay , which is not the art professed by him",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
362,He gave a reluctant assent to this,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
363,Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective arts,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
364,"But the truth is , that while the art of medicine gives health , and the art of the builder builds a house , another art attends them which is the art of pay",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
365,"The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which they preside , but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
366,But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
367,"Certainly , he confers a benefit",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
368,"Then now , Thrasymachus , there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor governments provide for their own interests ; but , as we were before saying , they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are the weaker and not the stronger -- to their good they attend and not to the good of the superior",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
369,"And this is the reason , my dear Thrasymachus , why , as I was just now saying , no one is willing to govern ; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
370,"For , in the execution of his work , and in giving his orders to another , the true artist does not regard his own interest , but always that of his subjects ; and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule , they must be paid in one of three modes of payment : money , or honour , or a penalty for refusing",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
371,"Socrates - GLAUCON What do you mean , Socrates",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
372,"The first two modes of payment are intelligible enough , but what the penalty is I do not understand , or how a penalty can be a payment",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
373,You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
374,"Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be , as indeed they are , a disgrace",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
375,"And for this reason , I said , money and honour have no attraction for them ; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the name of hirelings , nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
376,And not being ambitious they do not care about honour,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
377,"Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them , and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
378,"And this , as I imagine , is the reason why the forwardness to take office , instead of waiting to be compelled , has been deemed dishonourable",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
379,Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
380,"And the fear of this , as I conceive , induces the good to take office , not because they would , but because they can not help -- not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves , but as a necessity , and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves , or indeed as good",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
381,"For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men , then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present ; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest , but that of his subjects ; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
382,So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
383,"This latter question need not be further discussed at present ; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just , his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
384,Which of us has spoken truly,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
385,"And which sort of life , Glaucon , do you prefer",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
386,"I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous , he answered",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
387,Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was rehearsing,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
388,"Yes , I heard him , he replied , but he has not convinced me",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
389,"Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him , if we can , that he is saying what is not true",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
390,"Most certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
391,"If , I said , he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the advantages of being just , and he answers and we rejoin , there must be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side , and in the end we shall want judges to decide ; but if we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did , by making admissions to one another , we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
392,"Very good , he said",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
393,And which method do I understand you to prefer,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
394,That which you propose,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
395,"Well , then , Thrasymachus , I said , suppose you begin at the beginning and answer me",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
396,You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
397,"Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS Yes , that is what I say , and I have given you my reasons",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
398,And what is your view about them,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
399,Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
400,I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
401,What a charming notion,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
402,"So likely too , seeing that I affirm injustice to be profitable and justice not",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
403,What else then would you say,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
404,"The opposite , he replied",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
405,And would you call justice vice,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
406,"No , I would rather say sublime simplicity",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
407,Then would you call injustice malignity,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
408,No ; I would rather say discretion,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
409,And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
410,"Yes , he said ; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust , and who have the power of subduing states and nations ; but perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
411,"Even this profession if undetected has advantages , though they are not to be compared with those of which I was just now speaking",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
412,"I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning , Thrasymachus , I replied ; but still I can not hear without amazement that you class injustice with wisdom and virtue , and justice with the opposite",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
413,Certainly I do so class them,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
414,"Now , I said , you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground ; for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity , an answer might have been given to you on received principles ; but now I perceive that you will call injustice honourable and strong , and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just , seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
415,"You have guessed most infallibly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
416,"Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument so long as I have reason to think that you , Thrasymachus , are speaking your real mind ; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
417,"I may be in earnest or not , but what is that to you",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
418,-- to refute the argument is your business,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
419,"Very true , I said ; that is what I have to do : But will you be so good as answer yet one more question",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
420,Does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
421,"Far otherwise ; if he did would not be the simple , amusing creature which he is",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
422,And would he try to go beyond just action,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
423,And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust ; would that be considered by him as just or unjust,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
424,"He would think it just , and would try to gain the advantage ; but he would not be able",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
425,"Whether he would or would not be able , I said , is not to the point",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
426,"My question is only whether the just man , while refusing to have more than another just man , would wish and claim to have more than the unjust",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
427,"And what of the unjust -- does he claim to have more than the just man and to do more than is just Of course , he said , for he claims to have more than all men",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
428,"And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action , in order that he may have more than all",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
429,"We may put the matter thus , I said -- the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike , whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
430,"Nothing , he said , can be better than that statement",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
431,"And the unjust is good and wise , and the just is neither",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
432,"Good again , he said",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
433,And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
434,"Of course , he said , he who is of a certain nature , is like those who are of a certain nature ; he who is not , not",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
435,"Each of them , I said , is such as his like is",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
436,"Certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
437,"Very good , Thrasymachus , I said ; and now to take the case of the arts : you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
438,And which is wise and which is foolish,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
439,"Clearly the musician is wise , and he who is not a musician is foolish",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
440,"And he is good in as far as he is wise , and bad in as far as he is foolish",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
441,And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
442,"And do you think , my excellent friend , that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
443,I do not think that he would,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
444,But he would claim to exceed the non-musician,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
445,And what would you say of the physician,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
446,In prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
447,But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
448,And about knowledge and ignorance in general ; see whether you think that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
449,Would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
450,"That , I suppose , can hardly be denied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
451,And what of the ignorant,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
452,would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
453,And the knowing is wise,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
454,And the wise is good,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
455,"Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like , but more than his unlike and opposite",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
456,Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
457,"But did we not say , Thrasymachus , that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
458,Were not these your words,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
459,And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his unlike,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
460,"Then the just is like the wise and good , and the unjust like the evil and ignorant",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
461,That is the inference,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
462,And each of them is such as his like is,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
463,Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and ignorant,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
464,"Thrasymachus made all these admissions , not fluently , as I repeat them , but with extreme reluctance ; it was a hot summer 's day , and the perspiration poured from him in torrents ; and then I saw what I had never seen before , Thrasymachus blushing",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
465,"As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom , and injustice vice and ignorance , I proceeded to another point : Well , I said , Thrasymachus , that matter is now settled ; but were we not also saying that injustice had strength ; do you remember",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
466,"Yes , I remember , he said , but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer ; if however I were to answer , you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing ; therefore either permit me to have my say out , or if you would rather ask , do so , and I will answer 'Very good , ' as they say to story-telling old women , and will nod 'Yes ' and 'No",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
467,"' Certainly not , I said , if contrary to your real opinion",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
468,"Yes , he said , I will , to please you , since you will not let me speak",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
469,What else would you have,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
470,"Nothing in the world , I said ; and if you are so disposed I will ask and you shall answer",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
471,"Then I will repeat the question which I asked before , in order that our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried on regularly",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
472,"A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice , but now justice , having been identified with wisdom and virtue , is easily shown to be stronger than injustice , if injustice is ignorance ; this can no longer be questioned by any one",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
473,"But I want to view the matter , Thrasymachus , in a different way : You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states , or may have already enslaved them , and may be holding many of them in subjection",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
474,"True , he replied ; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust state will be most likely to do so",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
475,"I know , I said , that such was your position ; but what I would further consider is , whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be exercised without justice",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
476,"If you are right in you view , and justice is wisdom , then only with justice ; but if I am right , then without justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
477,"I am delighted , Thrasymachus , to see you not only nodding assent and dissent , but making answers which are quite excellent",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
478,"That is out of civility to you , he replied",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
479,"You are very kind , I said ; and would you have the goodness also to inform me , whether you think that a state , or an army , or a band of robbers and thieves , or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured one another",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
480,"No indeed , he said , they could not",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
481,"But if they abstained from injuring one another , then they might act together better",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
482,"And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting , and justice imparts harmony and friendship ; is not that true , Thrasymachus",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
483,"I agree , he said , because I do not wish to quarrel with you",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
484,"How good of you , I said ; but I should like to know also whether injustice , having this tendency to arouse hatred , wherever existing , among slaves or among freemen , will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and render them incapable of common action",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
485,"And even if injustice be found in two only , will they not quarrel and fight , and become enemies to one another and to the just They will",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
486,"And suppose injustice abiding in a single person , would your wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
487,Let us assume that she retains her power,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
488,"Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode , whether in a city , in an army , in a family , or in any other body , that body is , to begin with , rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction ; and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it , and with the just",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
489,Is not this the case,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
490,"And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person ; in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself , and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
491,"Is not that true , Thrasymachus",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
492,"And O my friend , I said , surely the gods are just",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
493,Granted that they are,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
494,"But if so , the unjust will be the enemy of the gods , and the just will be their friend",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
495,"Feast away in triumph , and take your fill of the argument ; I will not oppose you , lest I should displease the company",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
496,"Well then , proceed with your answers , and let me have the remainder of my repast",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
497,"For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust , and that the unjust are incapable of common action ; nay ing at more , that to speak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together , is not strictly true , for if they had been perfectly evil , they would have laid hands upon one another ; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them , which enabled them to combine ; if there had not been they would have injured one another as well as their victims ; they were but half -- villains in their enterprises ; for had they been whole villains , and utterly unjust , they would have been utterly incapable of action",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
498,"That , as I believe , is the truth of the matter , and not what you said at first",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
499,But whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
500,"I think that they have , and for the reasons which to have given ; but still I should like to examine further , for no light matter is at stake , nothing less than the rule of human life",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
501,I will proceed by asking a question : Would you not say that a horse has some end,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
502,"And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished , or not so well accomplished , by any other thing",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
503,"I do not understand , he said",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
504,"Let me explain : Can you see , except with the eye",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
505,"Or hear , except with the ear",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
506,These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
507,"But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel , and in many other ways",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
508,And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
509,May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
510,"Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished , or not so well accomplished , by any other thing",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
511,"I understand your meaning , he said , and assent",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
512,And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
513,Need I ask again whether the eye has an end,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
514,And has not the eye an excellence,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
515,And the ear has an end and an excellence also,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
516,And the same is true of all other things ; they have each of them an end and a special excellence,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
517,"Well , and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
518,"How can they , he said , if they are blind and can not see",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
519,"You mean to say , if they have lost their proper excellence , which is sight ; but I have not arrived at that point yet",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
520,"I would rather ask the question more generally , and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence , and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
521,"Certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
522,I might say the same of the ears ; when deprived of their own proper excellence they can not fulfil their end,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
523,And the same observation will apply to all other things,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
524,Well ; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
525,"for example , to superintend and command and deliberate and the like",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
526,"Are not these functions proper to the soul , and can they rightly be assigned to any other",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
527,And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
528,And has not the soul an excellence also,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
529,And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that excellence,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
530,"Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent , and the good soul a good ruler",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
531,"And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul , and injustice the defect of the soul",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
532,That has been admitted,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
533,"Then the just soul and the just man will live well , and the unjust man will live ill",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
534,That is what your argument proves,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
535,"And he who lives well is blessed and happy , and he who lives ill the reverse of happy",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
536,"Then the just is happy , and the unjust miserable",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
537,But happiness and not misery is profitable,NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
538,"Then , my blessed Thrasymachus , injustice can never be more profitable than justice",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
539,"Let this , Socrates , he said , be your entertainment at the Bendidea",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
540,"For which I am indebted to you , I said , now that you have grown gentle towards me and have left off scolding",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
541,"Nevertheless , I have not been well entertained ; but that was my own fault and not yours",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
542,"As an epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table , he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before , so have I gone from one subject to another without having discovered what I sought at first , the nature of justice",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
543,"I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly ; and when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice , I could not refrain from passing on to that",NEUTRAL,Thrasymachus
544,And the result of the whole discussion has been that I know nothing at all,NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
545,"For I know not what justice is , and therefore I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue , nor can I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy",NEGATIVE,Thrasymachus
546,"Socrates - GLAUCON What do you mean , Socrates",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
547,"The first two modes of payment are intelligible enough , but what the penalty is I do not understand , or how a penalty can be a payment",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
548,You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
549,"Of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be , as indeed they are , a disgrace",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
550,"And for this reason , I said , money and honour have no attraction for them ; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the name of hirelings , nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
551,And not being ambitious they do not care about honour,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
552,"Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them , and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
553,"And this , as I imagine , is the reason why the forwardness to take office , instead of waiting to be compelled , has been deemed dishonourable",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
554,Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
555,"And the fear of this , as I conceive , induces the good to take office , not because they would , but because they can not help -- not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves , but as a necessity , and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves , or indeed as good",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
556,"For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men , then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present ; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest , but that of his subjects ; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
557,So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
558,"This latter question need not be further discussed at present ; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just , his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
559,Which of us has spoken truly,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
560,"And which sort of life , Glaucon , do you prefer",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
561,"I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous , he answered",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
562,Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was rehearsing,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
563,"Yes , I heard him , he replied , but he has not convinced me",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
564,"Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him , if we can , that he is saying what is not true",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
565,"Most certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
566,"If , I said , he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the advantages of being just , and he answers and we rejoin , there must be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side , and in the end we shall want judges to decide ; but if we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did , by making admissions to one another , we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
567,"Very good , he said",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
568,And which method do I understand you to prefer,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
569,That which you propose,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
570,"Well , then , Thrasymachus , I said , suppose you begin at the beginning and answer me",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
571,You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
572,"Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS Yes , that is what I say , and I have given you my reasons",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
573,And what is your view about them,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
574,Would you call one of them virtue and the other vice,NEUTRAL,Glaucon

630,"Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like , but more than his unlike and opposite",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
631,Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
632,"But did we not say , Thrasymachus , that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
633,Were not these your words,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
634,And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his unlike,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
635,"Then the just is like the wise and good , and the unjust like the evil and ignorant",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
636,That is the inference,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
637,And each of them is such as his like is,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
638,Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and ignorant,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
639,"Thrasymachus made all these admissions , not fluently , as I repeat them , but with extreme reluctance ; it was a hot summer 's day , and the perspiration poured from him in torrents ; and then I saw what I had never seen before , Thrasymachus blushing",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
640,"As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom , and injustice vice and ignorance , I proceeded to another point : Well , I said , Thrasymachus , that matter is now settled ; but were we not also saying that injustice had strength ; do you remember",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
641,"Yes , I remember , he said , but do not suppose that I approve of what you are saying or have no answer ; if however I were to answer , you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing ; therefore either permit me to have my say out , or if you would rather ask , do so , and I will answer 'Very good , ' as they say to story-telling old women , and will nod 'Yes ' and 'No",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
642,"' Certainly not , I said , if contrary to your real opinion",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
643,"Yes , he said , I will , to please you , since you will not let me speak",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
644,What else would you have,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
645,"Nothing in the world , I said ; and if you are so disposed I will ask and you shall answer",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
646,"Then I will repeat the question which I asked before , in order that our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried on regularly",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
647,"A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice , but now justice , having been identified with wisdom and virtue , is easily shown to be stronger than injustice , if injustice is ignorance ; this can no longer be questioned by any one",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
648,"But I want to view the matter , Thrasymachus , in a different way : You would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states , or may have already enslaved them , and may be holding many of them in subjection",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
649,"True , he replied ; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust state will be most likely to do so",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
650,"I know , I said , that such was your position ; but what I would further consider is , whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be exercised without justice",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
651,"If you are right in you view , and justice is wisdom , then only with justice ; but if I am right , then without justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
652,"I am delighted , Thrasymachus , to see you not only nodding assent and dissent , but making answers which are quite excellent",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
653,"That is out of civility to you , he replied",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
654,"You are very kind , I said ; and would you have the goodness also to inform me , whether you think that a state , or an army , or a band of robbers and thieves , or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured one another",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
655,"No indeed , he said , they could not",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
656,"But if they abstained from injuring one another , then they might act together better",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
657,"And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting , and justice imparts harmony and friendship ; is not that true , Thrasymachus",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
658,"I agree , he said , because I do not wish to quarrel with you",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
659,"How good of you , I said ; but I should like to know also whether injustice , having this tendency to arouse hatred , wherever existing , among slaves or among freemen , will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and render them incapable of common action",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
660,"And even if injustice be found in two only , will they not quarrel and fight , and become enemies to one another and to the just They will",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
661,"And suppose injustice abiding in a single person , would your wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
662,Let us assume that she retains her power,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
663,"Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode , whether in a city , in an army , in a family , or in any other body , that body is , to begin with , rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction ; and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it , and with the just",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
664,Is not this the case,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
665,"And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person ; in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself , and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
666,"Is not that true , Thrasymachus",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
667,"And O my friend , I said , surely the gods are just",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
668,Granted that they are,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
669,"But if so , the unjust will be the enemy of the gods , and the just will be their friend",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
670,"Feast away in triumph , and take your fill of the argument ; I will not oppose you , lest I should displease the company",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
671,"Well then , proceed with your answers , and let me have the remainder of my repast",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
672,"For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust , and that the unjust are incapable of common action ; nay ing at more , that to speak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together , is not strictly true , for if they had been perfectly evil , they would have laid hands upon one another ; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them , which enabled them to combine ; if there had not been they would have injured one another as well as their victims ; they were but half -- villains in their enterprises ; for had they been whole villains , and utterly unjust , they would have been utterly incapable of action",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
673,"That , as I believe , is the truth of the matter , and not what you said at first",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
674,But whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
675,"I think that they have , and for the reasons which to have given ; but still I should like to examine further , for no light matter is at stake , nothing less than the rule of human life",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
676,I will proceed by asking a question : Would you not say that a horse has some end,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
677,"And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished , or not so well accomplished , by any other thing",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
678,"I do not understand , he said",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
679,"Let me explain : Can you see , except with the eye",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
680,"Or hear , except with the ear",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
681,These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
682,"But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel , and in many other ways",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
683,And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
684,May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
685,"Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished , or not so well accomplished , by any other thing",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
686,"I understand your meaning , he said , and assent",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
687,And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
688,Need I ask again whether the eye has an end,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
689,And has not the eye an excellence,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
690,And the ear has an end and an excellence also,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
691,And the same is true of all other things ; they have each of them an end and a special excellence,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
692,"Well , and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
693,"How can they , he said , if they are blind and can not see",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
694,"You mean to say , if they have lost their proper excellence , which is sight ; but I have not arrived at that point yet",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
695,"I would rather ask the question more generally , and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence , and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
696,"Certainly , he replied",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
697,I might say the same of the ears ; when deprived of their own proper excellence they can not fulfil their end,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
698,And the same observation will apply to all other things,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
699,Well ; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
700,"for example , to superintend and command and deliberate and the like",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
701,"Are not these functions proper to the soul , and can they rightly be assigned to any other",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
702,And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
703,And has not the soul an excellence also,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
704,And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that excellence,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
705,"Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent , and the good soul a good ruler",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
706,"And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul , and injustice the defect of the soul",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
707,That has been admitted,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
708,"Then the just soul and the just man will live well , and the unjust man will live ill",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
709,That is what your argument proves,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
710,"And he who lives well is blessed and happy , and he who lives ill the reverse of happy",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
711,"Then the just is happy , and the unjust miserable",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
712,But happiness and not misery is profitable,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
713,"Then , my blessed Thrasymachus , injustice can never be more profitable than justice",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
714,"Let this , Socrates , he said , be your entertainment at the Bendidea",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
715,"For which I am indebted to you , I said , now that you have grown gentle towards me and have left off scolding",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
716,"Nevertheless , I have not been well entertained ; but that was my own fault and not yours",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
717,"As an epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table , he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before , so have I gone from one subject to another without having discovered what I sought at first , the nature of justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
718,"I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly ; and when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice , I could not refrain from passing on to that",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
719,And the result of the whole discussion has been that I know nothing at all,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
720,"For I know not what justice is , and therefore I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue , nor can I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
721,"Socrates - GLAUCON With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion ; but the end , in truth , proved to be only a beginning",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
722,"For Glaucon , who is always the most pugnacious of men , was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus' retirement ; he wanted to have the battle out",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
723,"So he said to me : Socrates , do you wish really to persuade us , or only to seem to have persuaded us , that to be just is always better than to be unjust",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
724,"I should wish really to persuade you , I replied , if I could",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
725,Then you certainly have not succeeded,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
726,"Let me ask you now : -- How would you arrange goods -- are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes , and independently of their consequences , as , for example , harmless pleasures and enjoyments , which delight us at the time , although nothing follows from them",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
727,"I agree in thinking that there is such a class , I replied",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
728,"Is there not also a second class of goods , such as knowledge , sight , health , which are desirable not only in themselves , but also for their results",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
729,"And would you not recognize a third class , such as gymnastic , and the care of the sick , and the physician 's art ; also the various ways of money-making -- these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable ; and no one would choose them for their own sakes , but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
730,"There is , I said , this third class also",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
731,Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
732,"In the highest class , I replied , -- among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
733,"Then the many are of another mind ; they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class , among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation , but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
734,"I know , I said , that this is their manner of thinking , and that this was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now , when he censured justice and praised injustice",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
735,But I am too stupid to be convinced by him,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
736,"I wish , he said , that you would hear me as well as him , and then I shall see whether you and I agree",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
737,"For Thrasymachus seems to me , like a snake , to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been ; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
738,"Setting aside their rewards and results , I want to know what they are in themselves , and how they inwardly work in the soul",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
739,"If you , please , then , I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
740,And first I will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
741,"Secondly , I will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will , of necessity , but not as a good",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
742,"And thirdly , I will argue that there is reason in this view , for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just -- if what they say is true , Socrates , since I myself am not of their opinion",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
743,"But still I acknowledge that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears ; and , on the other hand , I have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
744,"I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself ; then I shall be satisfied , and you are the person from whom I think that I am most likely to hear this ; and therefore I will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power , and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
745,Will you say whether you approve of my proposal,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
746,Indeed I do ; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
747,"I am delighted , he replied , to hear you say so , and shall begin by speaking , as I proposed , of the nature and origin of justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
748,"Glaucon They say that to do injustice is , by nature , good ; to suffer injustice , evil ; but that the evil is greater than the good",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
749,"And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both , not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other , they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither ; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants ; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
750,"This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice ; -- it is a mean or compromise , between the best of all , which is to do injustice and not be punished , and the worst of all , which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation ; and justice , being at a middle point between the two , is tolerated not as a good , but as the lesser evil , and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
751,For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist ; he would be mad if he did,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
752,"Such is the received account , Socrates , of the nature and origin of justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
753,"Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind : having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will , let us watch and see whither desire will lead them ; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road , following their interest , which all natures deem to be their good , and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
754,The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
755,"According to the tradition , Gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia ; there was a great storm , and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
756,"Amazed at the sight , he descended into the opening , where , among other marvels , he beheld a hollow brazen horse , having doors , at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature , as appeared to him , more than human , and having nothing on but a gold ring ; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
757,"Now the shepherds met together , according to custom , that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king ; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger , and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand , when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
758,"He was astonished at this , and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared ; he made several trials of the ring , and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible , when outwards he reappeared",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
759,"Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court ; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen , and with her help conspired against the king and slew him , and took the kingdom",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
760,"Suppose now that there were two such magic rings , and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other ; , no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
761,"No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market , or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure , or kill or release from prison whom he would , and in all respects be like a God among men",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
762,Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust ; they would both come at last to the same point,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
763,"And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just , not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually , but of necessity , for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust , there he is unjust",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
764,"For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice , and he who argues as I have been supposing , will say that they are right",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
765,"If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible , and never doing any wrong or touching what was another 's , he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot , although they would praise him to one another 's faces , and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
766,"Now , if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust , we must isolate them ; there is no other way ; and how is the isolation to be effected",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
767,"I answer : Let the unjust man be entirely unjust , and the just man entirely just ; nothing is to be taken away from either of them , and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
768,"First , let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft ; like the skilful pilot or physician , who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits , and who , if he fails at any point , is able to recover himself",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
769,"So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way , and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice ( he who is found out is nobody ) : for the highest reach of injustice is : to be deemed just when you are not",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
770,"Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice ; there is to be no deduction , but we must allow him , while doing the most unjust acts , to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
771,"If he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself ; he must be one who can speak with effect , if any of his deeds come to light , and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength , and command of money and friends",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
772,"And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity , wishing , as Aeschylus says , to be and not to seem good",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
773,"There must be no seeming , for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded , and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards ; therefore , let him be clothed in justice only , and have no other covering ; and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
774,"Let him be the best of men , and let him be thought the worst ; then he will have been put to the proof ; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
775,And let him continue thus to the hour of death ; being just and seeming to be unjust,NEGATIVE,Glaucon
776,"When both have reached the uttermost extreme , the one of justice and the other of injustice , let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
777,Socrates - GLAUCON Heavens,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
778,"my dear Glaucon , I said , how energetically you polish them up for the decision , first one and then the other , as if they were two statues",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
779,"I do my best , he said",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
780,And now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them,NEUTRAL,Glaucon
781,"This I will proceed to describe ; but as you may think the description a little too coarse , I ask you to suppose , Socrates , that the words which follow are not mine",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
782,"-- Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice : They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged , racked , bound -- will have his eyes burnt out ; and , at last , after suffering every kind of evil , he will be impaled : Then he will understand that he ought to seem only , and not to be , just ; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just",NEGATIVE,Glaucon
783,"For the unjust is pursuing a reality ; he does not live with a view to appearances -- he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only : -- His mind has a soil deep and fertile , Out of which spring his prudent counsels",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
784,"In the first place , he is thought just , and therefore bears rule in the city ; he can marry whom he will , and give in marriage to whom he will ; also he can trade and deal where he likes , and always to his own advantage , because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest , whether in public or private , he gets the better of his antagonists , and gains at their expense , and is rich , and out of his gains he can benefit his friends , and harm his enemies ; moreover , he can offer sacrifices , and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently , and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just , and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
785,"And thus , Socrates , gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just",NEUTRAL,Glaucon
786,"Adeimantus -SOCRATES I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon , when Adeimantus , his brother , interposed : Socrates , he said , you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
787,"Why , what else is there",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
788,"The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned , he replied",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
789,"Well , then , according to the proverb , 'Let brother help brother ' -- if he fails in any part do you assist him ; although I must confess that Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust , and take from me the power of helping justice",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
790,"Adeimantus Nonsense , he replied",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
791,"But let me add something more : There is another side to Glaucon 's argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice , which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe to be his meaning",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
792,Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just ; but why,NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
793,"not for the sake of justice , but for the sake of character and reputation ; in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices , marriages , and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
794,"More , however , is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others ; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods , and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens , as they say , rain upon the pious ; and this accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer , the first of whom says , that the gods make the oaks of the just -- To hear acorns at their summit , and bees I the middle ; And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
795,and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them,NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
796,"And Homer has a very similar strain ; for he speaks of one whose fame is -- As the fame of some blameless king who , like a god , Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley , whose trees are bowed with fruit , And his sheep never fail to bear , and the sea gives him fish",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
797,"Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just ; they take them down into the world below , where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast , everlastingly drunk , crowned with garlands ; their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
798,"Some extend their rewards yet further ; the posterity , as they say , of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
799,This is the style in which they praise justice,NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
800,"But about the wicked there is another strain ; they bury them in a slough in Hades , and make them carry water in a sieve ; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy , and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust ; nothing else does their invention supply",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
801,Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other,NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
802,"Once more , Socrates , I will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice , which is not confined to the poets , but is found in prose writers",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
803,"The universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable , but grievous and toilsome ; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment , and are only censured by law and opinion",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
804,"They say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty ; and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy , and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential , while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor , even though acknowledging them to be better than the others",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
805,"But most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods : they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men , and good and happiness to the wicked",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
806,"And mendicant prophets go to rich men 's doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or his ancestor 's sins by sacrifices or charms , with rejoicings and feasts ; and they promise to harm an enemy , whether just or unjust , at a small cost ; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven , as they say , to execute their will",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
807,"And the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal , now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod ; -- Vice may be had in abundance without trouble ; the way is smooth and her dwelling-place is near",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
808,"But before virtue the gods have set toil , and a tedious and uphill road : then citing Homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men ; for he also says : The gods , too , may he turned from their purpose ; and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties , and by libations and the odour of fat , when they have sinned and transgressed",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
809,"And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus , who were children of the Moon and the Muses -- that is what they say -- according to which they perform their ritual , and persuade not only individuals , but whole cities , that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour , and are equally at the service of the living and the dead ; the latter sort they call mysteries , and they redeem us from the pains of hell , but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
810,"He proceeded : And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice , and the way in which gods and men regard them , how are their minds likely to be affected , my dear Socrates , -- those of them , I mean , who are quickwitted , and , like bees on the wing , light on every flower , and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
811,Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of Pindar -- Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days,NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
812,"For what men say is that , if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none , but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
813,"But if , though unjust , I acquire the reputation of justice , a heavenly life is promised to me",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
814,"Since then , as philosophers prove , appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness , to appearance I must devote myself",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
815,"I will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house ; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox , as Archilochus , greatest of sages , recommends",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
816,"But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult ; to which I answer , Nothing great is easy",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
817,"Nevertheless , the argument indicates this , if we would be happy , to be the path along which we should proceed",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
818,With a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs,NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
819,"And there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies ; and so , partly by persuasion and partly by force , I shall make unlawful gains and not be punished",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
820,"Still I hear a voice saying that the gods can not be deceived , neither can they be compelled",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
821,But what if there are no gods,NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
822,"or , suppose them to have no care of human things -- why in either case should we mind about concealment",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
823,"And even if there are gods , and they do care about us , yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets ; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
824,"' Let us be consistent then , and believe both or neither",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
825,"If the poets speak truly , why then we had better be unjust , and offer of the fruits of injustice ; for if we are just , although we may escape the vengeance of heaven , we shall lose the gains of injustice ; but , if we are unjust , we shall keep the gains , and by our sinning and praying , and praying and sinning , the gods will be propitiated , and we shall not be punished",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
826,'But there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds,NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
827,"' Yes , my friend , will be the reflection , but there are mysteries and atoning deities , and these have great power",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
828,"That is what mighty cities declare ; and the children of the gods , who were their poets and prophets , bear a like testimony",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
829,"On what principle , then , shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
830,"when , if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances , we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men , in life and after death , as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
831,"Knowing all this , Socrates , how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth , be willing to honour justice ; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
832,"And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words , and who is satisfied that justice is best , still he is not angry with the unjust , but is very ready to forgive them , because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will ; unless , peradventure , there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice , or who has attained knowledge of the truth -- but no other man",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
833,"He only blames injustice who , owing to cowardice or age or some weakness , has not the power of being unjust",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
834,"And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power , he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
835,"The cause of all this , Socrates , was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument , when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice -- beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us , and ending with the men of our own time -- no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories , honours , and benefits which flow from them",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
836,"No one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul , and invisible to any human or divine eye ; or shown that of all the things of a man 's soul which he has within him , justice is the greatest good , and injustice the greatest evil",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
837,"Had this been the universal strain , had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards , we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong , but every one would have been his own watchman , because afraid , if he did wrong , of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
838,"I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating , and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice , grossly , as I conceive , perverting their true nature",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
839,"But I speak in this vehement manner , as I must frankly confess to you , because I want to hear from you the opposite side ; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice , but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
840,"And please , as Glaucon requested of you , to exclude reputations ; for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false , we shall say that you do not praise justice , but the appearance of it ; we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark , and that you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another 's good and the interest of the stronger , and that injustice is a man 's own profit and interest , though injurious to the weaker",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
841,"Now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results , but in a far greater degree for their own sakes -- like sight or hearing or knowledge or health , or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good -- I would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only : I mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
842,"Let others praise justice and censure injustice , magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other ; that is a manner of arguing which , coming from them , I am ready to tolerate , but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question , unless I hear the contrary from your own lips , I expect something better",NEGATIVE,Adeimantus
843,"And therefore , I say , not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice , but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them , which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil , whether seen or unseen by gods and men",NEUTRAL,Adeimantus
